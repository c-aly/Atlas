# AWS Lambda requirements
# Note: For CLIP processing, you'll need a Lambda container image with PyTorch

Pillow==10.1.0
numpy==1.24.3

# NOTE: boto3/botocore removed for local development to avoid requiring AWS keys.
# If you later deploy Lambda, restore boto3 and botocore pinned versions here.

# open-clip-torch==2.23.0
# torch==2.1.0 (CPU version)
